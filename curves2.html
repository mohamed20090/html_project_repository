 A learning curve is a plot of model learning performance over experience or time.Learning curves are a widely used diagnostic tool
 in machine learning for algorithms that learn from a training dataset incrementally. The model can be evaluated on the training dataset
 and on a hold out validation dataset after each update during training and plots of the measured performance can created to show learning 
curves.Reviewing learning curves of models during training can be used to diagnose problems with learning, such as an underfit or overfit 
model, as well as whether the training and validation datasets are suitably representative.In this post, you will discover learning curves
and how they can be used to diagnose the learning and generalization behavior of machine learning models, with example plots showing common learning problems.
