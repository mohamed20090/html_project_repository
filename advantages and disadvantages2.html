is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence
(NI) displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research
is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully
achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied
when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with
other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI),
in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or
Internet searches or driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many
researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may
outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving
equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task</p>
