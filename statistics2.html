Although the use of AI remains relatively low across organizations, statistics show that an increasing 
number of enterprises are starting to employ it within their business operations.In 2015, just ten percent 
of organizations reported that they either already used artificial intelligence technology or would be doing 
so in the near future. Fast forward to 2019 and that number rose to 37 percent, which means that more than one
in three organizations are either using artificial intelligence or have plans to do so (Gartner, 2019).
This represents an impressive 270 percent growth in just four years. Most of this growth came from 2018 to 2019, during which 
the usage of AI within organizations as much as tripled.In fact, it’s clear that organizations are starting to pay more and more 
attention to the power of artificial intelligence. It’s been named the most disruptive technology by chief intelligence officers 
and IT leaders worldwide, surpassing data and analytics.
